		<td>
			We start by implementing the last of our ciphers: the Vigenère cipher. This requires the use of object composition, a powerful way of reusing code.

		</td>
		<td>
			We consider the concepts of polymorphism and shared type in C++ by reviewing the built-in types and templated types as seen in the previous weeks. We motivate sharing type by considering how objects may change through the lifetime of a program and how templates, whilst allowing polymorphic behaviour, lock the behaviour in when our program is compiled. In C++ we show how runtime polymorphism is realised with public inheritance and pure abstract classes specifying an interface.
