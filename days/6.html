		</td>
		<td>
			We examine the "legacy" features of raw pointers, C-style arrays and how to manually perform dynamic memory allocation.

		</td>
		<td>
			We give more detail on the special member functions (copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, move assignment operator, destructor) and some general discussion of operator overloading (PDF Document) , and then an overview of the other containers available in the Standard Library, including some ideas of when it is appropriate to use each one and how to more efficiently use them.

		</td>
		<td>
			We take a very quick look at a couple more of the more advanced features of (and in some cases very recent additions to) the C++ language. In particular, regular expressions and random number generation.
